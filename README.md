# coolcompiler
Implementation of a compiler for the cool programming language.
This is a project from the Stanford Online compiler course ( stanford lagunita ).
The directory CoolCompiler contains the complete compiler with a custom lexer and recursive descent parser written by hand.
The directory pa1 contains the lexer written with Jlex, pa2 the parser with javacup, pa3 the semantic analyzer and pa4 the code generator, all in java.
The directory pa1c++, pa2c++ and pa3c++ contains repectively the lexer with lex, the parser with bison and the semantic analyzer in c++.
